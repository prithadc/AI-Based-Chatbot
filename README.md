# **AI-Powered Chatbot**

An interactive AI chatbot powered by LangChain, OpenAI, and Weaviate, designed to demonstrate the capabilities of conversational AI using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Dockerized deployment.

---

## **Features**

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Leverages OpenAI's GPT model for understanding user queries.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Retrieves relevant information from a Weaviate vector database to provide precise and context-aware responses.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built with LangChain for simplified chaining of AI and retrieval processes.
- **RESTful API**: Supports integration with external applications via REST endpoints.
- **Dockerized Setup**: Ensures seamless deployment and portability.
- **Environment Management**: Uses virtual environments for clean dependency management.

## **Installation**

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker & Docker Compose
- OpenAI API Key
- Weaviate Cloud instance or local setup

---

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-chatbot.git
cd ai-chatbot
```

### **2. Set Up Python Environment**
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```cmd
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Linux/Mac:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **3. Configure Environment Variables**
1. Create a `.env` file:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```
2. Add your keys:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   WEAVIATE_URL=http://localhost:8080
   ```

### **4. Start the Application**
Run the chatbot server:
```bash
python langchain/langchain_server.py
```

---

## **Usage**

### **API Endpoints**
- **GET /chat**: Interact with the chatbot.
- **POST /index**: Add new data to the Weaviate database.

### **Dockerized Deployment**
1. Build and run the container:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. Access the chatbot at `http://localhost:5000`.

## **Demo**

Include screenshots, videos, or a GIF demonstrating the chatbot in action.

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)**: For building AI chains.
- **[Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/)**: Vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings.
- **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)**: GPT for natural language processing.
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment.
- **Python**: Backend language.
